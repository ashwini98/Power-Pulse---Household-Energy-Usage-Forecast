# Power-Pulse - Household Energy Usage Forecast

## Overview
In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize energy usage trends.
- Engineer features from datetime and sub-metering variables.
- Train regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and KNN.
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
- Identify key features influencing energy usage using feature importance analysis.
- Visualize prediction performance and insights with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Save the best model for real-world deployment using pickle or joblib.
